i have an excel sheet called "fci-temp.xlsx" containing 3 sheets ( table 1 , table 2 , table 3). 
i want to make a copy from that sheet foe each time i will download it . 
i want to download it from the fci assesments screen inside every school to be a download button . 
the filling rules is like so : 
L2 cell = school name 
J2 رقم عداد الكهرباء
J3 رقم عداد المياة
starting from J6 at the 3 sheets is the beggining of the items that we have in the fci assesment , so i want to map throught them and equalize them with our data to know which item will be filled with its corresponding value . 
then we start from I6 (N/A) , H6 (تالف) , G6 (حرج) , F6 (ضعيف) , E6 (مناسب) , D6 (جيد) . 
so i want to fill these values with our real values from the fci assesment
